# bus-booking

## Overview

The Bus Booking System is a Django-based web application that allows users to search for bus routes, make reservations, and manage their bookings. The app provides several key features:

Bus Routes: Users can view a list of available bus routes, including information about route names, stops, and estimated travel times.

Route Search: Users can search for specific bus routes based on route names, helping them quickly find the desired route.

Bus Management (Admin): Administrators can add, view, update, and delete bus information, including bus numbers, departure locations, arrival locations, departure times, and capacity.

Seat Availability: The app checks seat availability for a selected bus, ensuring that users do not select seats that are already reserved or exceed the bus's capacity.

Booking Creation: Users can create reservations by selecting a bus, route, and available seats. The system ensures that the selected seats are available and do not exceed the bus's capacity.

Booking Confirmation: Users can confirm their bookings, marking them as "confirmed" and reserving the selected seats. Once confirmed, bookings cannot be modified.

Booking History: Users can view their booking history, including details of confirmed bookings, such as the bus, route, and status.

Reservation Management: Administrators can view and manage reservations, including creating, updating, and deleting reservations.

Payment Integration: The app includes the ability to make payments for reservations. Users can make payments securely, and payment details are associated with each reservation.

Seat Management: Users can view a list of available seats and their statuses (available or reserved). Administrators can also manage seats.

User Authentication: The app provides user authentication to ensure that only authenticated users can create bookings and view their booking history.

Security and Error Handling: The app incorporates security measures to protect against common vulnerabilities, and it includes error handling to provide informative responses to users.
